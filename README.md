## Hi there 👋

I am a Master's Student at the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy Heidelberg (MPIA) working on massive star-formation. I am interested in the dynamics of molecular gas and filamentary structures.

- I’m currently working on massive star formation and filamentary accretion-flows in detail.
- I’m currently learning about calculations of molecular column densities and radio interferometry.

I will provide some code snippets from my accretion-flow analysis soon. I make use of the FilFinder Algorithm (https://fil-finder.readthedocs.io/en/latest) from Eric Koch to identify structures from molecular data cubes. The velocity information is extracted from each velocity channel and used for a mass-flow rate estimation. This mass-flow rate estimation follows several approaches already discussed in the literature. In Cygnus X DR22 however, I calculate molecular column densities instead of using the dust continuum emission. This process is something I want to implement into a ready-to-use routine.
