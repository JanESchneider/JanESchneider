## Hi there 👋

I am a Master's Student at the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy Heidelberg (MPIA) working on massive star-formation. I am interested in the dynamics of molecular gas and filamentary structures.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on massive star formation and filamentary accretion-flows in detail.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about calculations of molecular column densities and radio interferometry.
